Bun is unethical and exploits whatever it can for profit.
It tries to benefits on the pure hype, while consistently underdelivering on promises.

What did Bun do wrong?
 - https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/657 – Ignored PR to make benchmarks more fair and then banned the author!
  - On another note, Jarred – making benchmarks fair is "gaming", but when you pull ~2K LOC just to make stringWidth faster its not?
 - https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/921 – Bun caches everything about SQLite and doesn't invalidate it properly
  - https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/1056#pullrequestreview-1079694125
  - https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/1332 – Even says that he doesn't want to invalidate it unless its equal to performance!\
    Why would you have working things, when they can be fast?
 - Completely outdated benchmarks on the website? <at the time of writing>:
  - Comparing Bun 1.0 to Deno 1.36.2 (1.35.2 on sqlite benchmark?) and Node 20.5.0 (20.4.0 on sqlite benchmark) where Deno 1.41 and Node 21.6.2 are available
 - Why doesn't Bun mention when its slower?
  - https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/5197 – 300x slower Regex than node
  - https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/8637 – 2.8k requests/s on sveltekit? My grandma runs faster!
  - https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/7428 – 100x slower than node AWS S3 writes
  - and more!...
 - Or that it doesn't actually support all web standards node or deno does?
  - And if it does, often incompletely?
 - Or that it segfaults... whenever it wants?
 - How about not caring about your own employees?
